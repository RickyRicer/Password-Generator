# Rick Ansay's Password Generator 

This week's homework assignment was to create a password generator, using javascript. You have the choice of selecting a from 8-12 characters, lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols. Happy passwording! 
## Lessons Learned

The biggest take away for me, keep it simple (stupid!). AFter watching and reading all the tutorials on making a password generator, I ended up not using any of the methods they used. I realized utilizing an array and 'else if' were going to be my best friends. After cleaning and simplifying my code, I'm extremely happy with the outcome!
